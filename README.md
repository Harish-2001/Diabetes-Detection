# Diabetes-Detection
To build a predictive model which classifies whether a person is diabetic or not based on the following parae=meters
1) Pregnancies
2) Glucose
3) Blood Pressure
4) Skin Thickness
5) Insulin
6) BMI
7) Diabetes Pedigree Function
8) Age
## Steps Involved
1) Importing Dataset
2) Analyse the Dataset
3) Splitting up of Data
4) Applying ML Algorithm
5) Evaluation of model
## Importing Dataset
The basic process of loading data from a CSV vile into a pandas dataframe is achieved using the "READ_CSV" function in pandas.
## Analysing dataset
Basically we need to analyse and remove the columns which are not necessary and use the ones which are necessary and handle the missing values if any.
## Splitting up of data
Data is splitted into training and testing set based on size of the dataset.
## Applying ML Algorithm
Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximation a mapping function(F) from input variables(X) to discrete output variables(Y).
1) Linear classifiers: Logistic Regression
2) Nearest Neighbor
3) Random Forest
## Evaluation of model
Accuracy is a common evaluation metric for classification problems. It's the number of correct predicitons made as a ratio of all predictions made.
